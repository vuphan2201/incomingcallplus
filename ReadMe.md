# Introduction #

Incoming Call Plus is a work-in-progress Android application which replaces the stock Android incoming call screen. Incoming Call Plus currently includes features like rejecting calls with a text message and customizing background color.

The final release of Incoming Call Plus will be completely customizable and loaded with advanced features. The public beta is currently available to download here, on the Android market, or on XDA Developers (http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=803464).

Some basic information about Incoming Call Plus:
  * Currently compatible with Android OS 2.0+. Support for earlier versions will come later.

> Please note that these is not a complete list of compatible devices. This list simply consists of devices that have been specifically confirmed by me or others. Incoming Call Plus is expected to work on all 2.0+ devices (although med and low resolution screens are not _officially_ supported yet). If you can confirm a device that is not on the list or find that there are issues with one of the devices on the list, please notify me. Thanks.
